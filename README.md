# CS-3502-Operating-Systems-Project-1

Hello, welcome to my project! In order

This project is broken down into two sub-projects A and B. In order to run these projects you will need to be running a Linux distirbution. You must also use an IDE of your choice.

Project A: Multi-threaded Bank Account system.
1. Multi-threaded processes including transfers, deposits, and withdrawals
2. Demonstrated proper resource protection using mutex locks
3. Ensured system is deadlock proof via try_locks and lock ordering


Project B: Inter-process communication (IPC) via pipes
1. Producer function to write message
2. Consumer function to read message
3. Main method to create pipe used for communication
